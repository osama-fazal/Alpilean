        <h2>Alpilean Supplement Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Alpilean&nbsp;</b>is a dietary supplement that works towards promoting weight loss in individuals
                suffering from overweight issues. It is one such supplement that helps in achieving your weight loss
                goals with its working and unique formulation.</li>
            <li>The working of Alpilean is based on a few mechanisms and processes that help you lose weight through
                natural means effectively.</li>
            <li>Consuming the Alpilean diet pills activates the process of thermogenesis in the human body.
                Thermogenesis is a process that produces heat in the body of most warm-blooded animals.</li>
            <li>Alpilean aims to normalize your inner body temperature, giving you the same advantage as people with
                high levels of muscle mass. Although the makers of Alpilean don’t specifically claim to raise core body
                temperature, they claim to return your body temperature to normal levels. That could mean heating your
                low internal body temperature to accelerate fat-burning results.</li>
            <li>Many people don’t realize it, but internal body temperature has nothing to do with how hot or cold your
                skin feels- it is the temperature of your internal organs/cells. Research from Switzerland has proven
                how inner body temperature is involved in the way that your body metabolizes fat.</li>
            <li>If you have a normal internal body temperature, you can quickly and effortlessly burn calories. However,
                the lower your body temperature, the slower your metabolism. In fact, according to research, metabolism
                slows by at least 13% with every drop in temperature.</li>
            <li>These new findings related to internal body temperature and weight loss is the primary reason that
                Alpilean Weight Loss Support was created.</li>

    <div class="left-align">
        <p class="title">Drumstick Tree Leaf:</p>
        <p class="description">It is the organic substance that is widely used as anti-inflammatory remedy that controls
            the inflammation across the body and prevents you from experiencing swelling and inflammation. Besides, the
            formula also increases the core temperature of your body that aids in burning off the fat cells quickly. It

        <p class="title">Dika Nut:

        </p>
        <p class="description">African Mango Seed is a light brown or almost white seed that is used in traditional
            African medicine. It has been traditionally used to treat conditions such as fatigue, poor digestion, and
            anemia. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, which helps to maintain healthy skin and eyes.As per the
            Alpilean makers, African mango seed can target inner temperature, ease digestion and bloating, and support
            healthy cholesterol levels.
            <br>
            <br>
            Further, it also contains high levels of antioxidants that help to fight off harmful free radicals in the
            body. Additionally, African Mango Seed is a good source of minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and zinc.
            These nutrients are important for overall health and can support nerve function, muscle contraction, joint
            movement, and more.


        </p>
        <p class="title">Golden Algae: </p>
        <p class="description">Alpilean contains fucoxanthin, a popular weight loss compound found in many diet pills
            sold online today. The fucoxanthin in Alpilean comes from a specific type of algae called golden algae.
            While other diet pills use brown seaweed extract to accelerate weight loss, Alpilean uses fucoxanthin from
            golden algae. According to the manufacturer, this golden algae will target inner temperature, support liver,
            and brain health, and support bone strength, among other benefits.

        </p>
        <p class="title">Ginger Rhizome:

        </p>
        <p class="description">It is a plant of the genus Zingiber and of the family Zingiberaceae, whose rhizome is
            used worldwide for cooking and in traditional medicine. It is very effective for losing weight.The bioactive
            compound in ginger, known as gingerol, is responsible for much of ginger’s medicinal properties. Gingerol
            has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which help fight the body’s free radicals.
            <br><br>

            It is also responsible for reducing oxidative stress in the body. Oxidative stress is a phenomenon caused by
            an imbalance between the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species. An increase in oxidative
            stress can increase the number of free radicals in your body.

        <p class="title">Vitamin B12

        </p>
        <p class="description">Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods like beef,
            liver, clams, and other dairy products. Vitamin B12 is very important in improving nerve function, cell
            metabolism, and the production of DNA. Vitamin B12 plays a key role in increasing fat metabolism. An
            increase in fat metabolism means your body will burn fat faster and help you in losing weight. A high blood
            level of vitamin B12 is directly linked to a low level of obesity.
            <br><br>
            Vitamin B12 also helps to increase your heart health. A deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to poor heart health
            and can cause several other diseases.
            <br><br>
            Vitamin B12 deficiency can result in megaloblastic anemia, where the number of red blood cells is lower than
            usual numbers. It can also lead to a lack of energy and contribute to fatigue.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Bigarade Orange:
        </p>
        <p class="description">Citrus Bioflavonoids are a type of flavonoid that is found in many citrus fruits. They
            are said to have weight loss benefits due to their ability to reduce fat storage and improve your body’s
            insulin sensitivity. Additionally, Citrus Bioflavonoids can help suppress the appetite and increase energy
            levels.Citrus Bioflavonoids are also believed to improve blood sugar levels, immune function, and
            cholesterol levels, making them an ideal choice for people with diabetes or high cholesterol levels.

        <h2>How Much Weight Can You Lose with Alpilean? </h2>
        <p><strong>Alpilean is backed by hundreds of five-star reviews online. In fact, the manufacturer claims over
                200,000+
                people use the same alpine method daily to detoxify their body, target inner body temperature, and lose
                weight.
                <br><br>
                Here are some of the weight loss testimonials shared by verified purchasers on the official Alpilean
                website:</strong>
            <br><br>
            One man claims he tried dieting, exercising, and taking supplements to lose weight, but nothing seemed to
            work. Then, he started taking Alpilean and experienced near-immediate results. He claims to have lost 28lbs
            without changing his diet. Alpilean has even stopped him from snoring.
            <br><br>
            Lillian Davis: “I’ve gone down four dress sizes. Four. I had no hesitation in trying it at all. It seriously
            completely changed my life and saved me a fortune in medical expenses. I now wake up happy, I have bundles
            of energy, best thing I’ve ever done for myself.”
            <br><br>
            Vivian Sun: “I’m down 31 pounds. In the morning my pajamas were so loose I had to hold them up to run to the
            bathroom. It all happened so fast for me, and I was slim before I even knew it, and then as time went on,
            the more weight I started to lose.”
            <br><br>
            Another reviewer claims to have lost 33lbs with Alpilean, describing the supplement as “like a magic trick.”
            She has lost 3 dress sizes with the supplement and is proud of her “sexy new body.”
            <br><br>
            One woman claims she has lost 34lbs thanks to Alpilean and now easily fits into the jeans she wore 15 years
            ago. Now, her daughter “is proud to call me her mom,” reports the verified purchaser.
            <br><br>
            Another woman, Cassie, claims to have dissolved 40lbs “in no time” while taking Alpilean. Cassie lost 4
            dress sizes in a short period – and she continues to lose weight.
            <br><br>
            Overall, the makers of Alpilean claim to have developed the formula based on a “tropical loophole” that
            “dissolves fat overnight.” By taking Alpilean daily, you can purportedly lose a significant amount of weight
            in a short period of time.
